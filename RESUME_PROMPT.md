# ðŸ”„ AI Resume Prompt

Use this exact prompt when continuing this project in a new AI session:

---

I'm working on a cyberpunk-themed interactive resume website called "CyberCity Resume". 
The project uses SvelteKit and Vercel, with game-like keyboard navigation through a 
rainy neon city where different districts represent resume sections.

I have key documentation in my workspace:
- PROJECT_PLAN.md - Complete project roadmap with 16 implementation stages
- STAGE_CHECKLIST.md - Progress tracker with checkboxes for all tasks
- HOW_TO_RESUME.md - Detailed guide for resuming the project

Please read PROJECT_PLAN.md and STAGE_CHECKLIST.md first to understand the full context.

Check STAGE_CHECKLIST.md to see my current progress. I'm on STAGE [X]: [Stage Name]

[ADD YOUR CONTEXT HERE - Examples below:]

Option A - Starting fresh stage:
"I just completed Stage [X-1] and I'm ready to begin Stage [X]."

Option B - Mid-stage continuation:
"I've completed these tasks in the current stage:
- Task 1
- Task 2
I need help with: [specific issue or next task]"

Option C - Need assessment:
"Can you check my workspace and determine where I left off?"

Option D - Have an issue:
"I'm stuck on [specific problem]. Here's what I tried: [details]"

Do NOT generate any code until you confirm you've read the project documents and 
understand the current stage requirements.
